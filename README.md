# BizCards
A quick way to create an online presence and connect with potential employers. 

# Problem/Objectives
College students have a lot of pressure to network and form relationships with potential employers. Students spend time and money writing and printing business cards, cover letters, and resumes. 

Recruiters get stacks of business cards, resumes and a mountain of unstructured emails with networking materials which creates a need for organization. This application creates a uniform way to receive studentsâ€™ contact information and qualifications. 

Our application allows users to create an electronic business card to facilitate networking connections.
